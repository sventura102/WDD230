                <p class="paragraph-1">The proximity on the Smith Center page immediately displays a theater
                    banner that shows us why we're here: to look for theater tickets. There is already an invitation to
                    the user, urging them to (in a sophisticated way) join them for a show.

                <p class="paragraph-2"> Aside from the image that I provided, there are plenty of 
                    examples of alignment on this website. When you hover over the dropdown bars, plenty
                    of information that the user would typically need is found. From the image that I provided, 
                    you can easily see that the alignment between the columns of the two blocks that show what the user
                    may be looking for in a broader, easy-to-read way for people that probably <b>can't</b> see the dropdown
                    bars.</p>

                <h2 class="principle-3"><b>PARC:</b>Repetition</h2>
                <p><b>Apple</b></p>
                <a class="link-3" href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">apple.com/mac</a>
                <img src="images\apple.jpg" alt="a mobile screencap of the apple website">
                <p class="paragraph-3">It was easy to see that the Apple website uses a lot of repition with the use of 
                    the 'I' alone but they also have their device types organized according to phones, tablets, and computers. Not only that
                    but the entire layout is consistent throughout the website regardless of what section that you're on.</p>
