        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>My target audience for this website are for the average person
            to be able to have access to know what the weather is like in any
            case that they need it.</p>
        <h1>Personas</h1>
            <h2>Persona 1</h2>
                <p>Steve is the average man that lives in a city, often communting to work by
                walking there, and needs to know what the weather is like so he can prepare
                for it.</p>
            <h2>Persona 2</h2>
                <p>Janelle lives in the country and grows different fruit on her farm to sell
                to the city. She needs to know the weather, air quality, and whether or not there
                will be rain so she can plan accordingly for her farm.</p>
        <h1>Scenarios</h1>
            <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
                <p>In the case that Johnny, who lives in New York City, is trying
                to decide whether or not to wear a jacket today. He checks the 
                weather app out of convenience because he lives in a twelve
                story building.</p>
            <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
                <p>Samantha works at a hospital in Seattle and tends to work between 12
                to 48 hour shifts. She hardly knows when it's day time, night time, or 
                what the weather is like outside. She checks the weather app so she knows
                to put on rain boots when it's raining outside. It rains often.</p>
            <h2>Scenario 3</h2>
                <p>Daisy is a grandmother that lives with her two grandchildren that are
                in elementary school. It snows very often where they live so she needs to
                know if it's safe to drive normally or if she needs to enable her spike tires
                in order to drive them to school safely.</p>
            <h2>Scenario 4</h2>
                <p>David lives in an area where the Air Quality Index can be very high sometimes,
                but it's convenient for him to live in that location due to his job, and unfortunately
                he's someone who is a little more sensitive to air quality changes. On a day where
                it is high, he has to take his medication so that it doesn't severly affect him.</p>
            <h2>Scenario 5</h2>
                <p>Jahzion lives in a city that can get extremely hot, up to 100 degrees, and checks
                the weather site in any case that he needs to wear lighter clothing.</p>
